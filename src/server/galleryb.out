{'title': 'InsulinBasalRatesv19', 'description': 'Among all diabetic patients with diabetes type 1 are those who carry an insulin pump. To my knowledge until now there isn\'t any tool which is suitable to support patients to log their basal rates. This app is aimed to archive commented basal rates, to visualize them and to post them out of the app directly to the therapist\'s phone with the option to store the redirected and corrected basal rate to the archive. The app offers several alternatives to put in each rate per hour inclusive a speech recognizer. The app can be regarded a first attempt to contribute to the field of an expanding digitalising in medicine having an interface for a better and quicker patient-therapist relationship on the basis of modern communication devices. A contribution to modern tele medicine with the possibility of a remote support. Finally and not to forget to mention the merits of the German diabetologist Dr. Rolf Renner, a former president of the German Diabetes Association, who has fundamentally contributed to establish the therapy with insulin pumps. Well known and multiply published are his analysis of the human insulin basal rates edited on the so called "Renner-Schieber" which are implemented in the "Presets" below.
